A hiker takes a number of steps either uphill (U) or downhill (D). A valley is defined as a sequence of steps below sea level that begins with a step down from sea level and ends with a step up to sea level.

You need to count how many valleys the hiker walked through during the hike.


CODE //


int countingValleys(int steps, string path) {
    int altitude = 0;
    int valleys = 0;

    for (char step : path) {
        if (step == 'U') {
            altitude++;
            if (altitude == 0) {
                valleys++;  // Just came up to sea level from a valley
            }
        } else if (step == 'D') {
            altitude--;
        }
    }

    return valleys;
}
