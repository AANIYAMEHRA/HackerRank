Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

For example, the square matrix  is shown below:

1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9  
The left-to-right diagonal = .
The right-to-left diagonal = .
Their absolute difference is .

Function description

Complete the  function with the following parameter:

: a 2-D array of integers
Return

: the absolute difference in sums along the diagonals
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, , the number of rows and columns in the square matrix .
Each of the next  lines describes a row, , and consists of  space-separated integers .


CODE //

int diagonalDifference(vector<vector<int>> arr) {
    int n = arr.size();
    int primaryDiagonal = 0, secondaryDiagonal = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        primaryDiagonal += arr[i][i];
        secondaryDiagonal += arr[i][n - i - 1];
    }

    return abs(primaryDiagonal - secondaryDiagonal);
}
