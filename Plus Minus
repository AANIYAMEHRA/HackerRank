Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are , , and . Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with 6 places after the decimal.

Note: This challenge introduces precision problems. The test cases are scaled to six decimal places, though answers with absolute error of up to  are acceptable.

Example

There are  elements: two positive, two negative and one zero. Their ratios are ,  and . Results are printed as:

0.400000
0.400000
0.200000
Function Description

Complete the  function with the following parameter(s):

: an array of integers
Print
Print the ratios of positive, negative and zero values in the array. Each value should be printed on a separate line with  digits after the decimal. The function should not return a value.


CODE //


void plusMinus(vector<int> arr) {
    int positive = 0, negative = 0, zero = 0;
    int n = arr.size();

    for (int num : arr) {
        if (num > 0)
            positive++;
        else if (num < 0)
            negative++;
        else
            zero++;
    }

    cout << fixed << setprecision(6) << (double)positive / n << endl;
    cout << fixed << setprecision(6) << (double)negative / n << endl;
    cout << fixed << setprecision(6) << (double)zero / n << endl;
}
